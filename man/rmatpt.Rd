\title{Generate Samples from the Mean-Adjusted Two-Piece Student's \eqn{t}-Distribution (MATPT)}
\usage{
rmatpt(N, gamma, nu)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Positive integer. The number of samples to generate.}

\item{gamma}{Positive numeric scalar. Skewness parameter (\eqn{\gamma > 0}).}

\item{nu}{Either a numeric scalar \eqn{\nu > 1} (degrees of freedom) or the string "normal" for
the normal limit (\eqn{\nu \to \infty}).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \eqn{N} containing the samples.
}
\description{
Produces independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from the MATPT distribution,
which is a zero-mean adjusted version of the two-piece Student's \eqn{t}-distribution (or normal).
The adjustment ensures that the error terms satisfy the zero-mean assumption, which is needed in cases such as mean regression or mediation analysis.
}
\details{
The MATPT distribution is defined by shifting the original two-piece Student's \eqn{t}-distribution
(with skewness parameter \eqn{\gamma} and degrees of freedom \eqn{\nu}) by its mean, ensuring the
resulting distribution has zero mean. The density of the MATPT distribution is given by:
\deqn{%
  \begin{aligned}
      p(\varepsilon|\gamma,\nu) = \frac{2}{\gamma + \frac{1}{\gamma}} \Bigg[& f_\nu\left(\frac{\varepsilon + m(\gamma,\nu)}{\gamma}\right) I_{[-m(\gamma,\nu),+\infty)}(\varepsilon) \;+ \\
      &f_\nu\left(\gamma\big(\varepsilon + m(\gamma,\nu)\big)\right) I_{(-\infty,-m(\gamma,\nu))}(\varepsilon) \Bigg], \quad \gamma \in \mathbb{R}_+, \; \nu > 1,
  \end{aligned}
}
where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{f_\nu} is the Student's \eqn{t}-density with \eqn{\nu} degrees of freedom.
\item \eqn{m(\gamma,\nu)} is the mean of the unadjusted two-piece distribution, computed by \code{\link{mean_two_piece_student}}.
\item \eqn{I_A(\varepsilon)} denotes the indicator function for set \eqn{A}.
}

# Generate samples from MATPT with gamma=2, nu=5 (Student's t case)
samples_t <- rmatpt(N = 1000, gamma = 2, nu = 5)
hist(samples_t, breaks = 30, main = "MATPT (nu=5)")

# Generate samples from MATPT with gamma=2 (normal case)
samples_norm <- rmatpt(N = 1000, gamma = 2, nu = "normal")
hist(samples_norm, breaks = 30, main = "MATPT (normal)")
